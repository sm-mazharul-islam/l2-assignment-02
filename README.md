if you try to run a project locally use ```npm run start:dev```. this project build has lots of libraries  if you want to see it go to the ```package.json``` file and you will see it. when you go terminal and type npm run start:dev I hope the project opens successfully, you also see that and go to the browser and type ```http:localhost5000/api/users``` then you also see all users in MongoDB.
